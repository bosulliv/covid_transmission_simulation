# Overview

The intent of this repo is to build a naive simulation of covid transmission
by specifically modelling nudge and peer pressure. Where nudges are direct
urgent messages from the government and/or the media. And peer pressure
specifically changes the likelihood of the desire to wear a mask in certain
situations.

This modelling will be hopelessly biased - I am just going to model my
interactions. So I do not expect this to roll-up into a UK predictive model. The
intent is to see what it takes to produce a model that converges: My hunch is
that this is very hard, and as you add variables it will tend to diverge
strongly. 

Why? Because it is now the only way to understand the dynamics of infection.
When the pandemic started and we were all vulnerable - it was scarily easy to
model with a simple Gamma function. But in year two, we are no longer as
vulnerable, and we change our behaviour based on our perception of risk.
